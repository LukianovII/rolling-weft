# Project Rules

> How the agent works in this project. Not a project description.
> Replace {placeholders} and fill Project Context before use.

## Core Behaviors

**Research before code.** For unfamiliar APIs, SDKs, or proprietary systems: investigate first,
check existing FINDING/LEARNED records in beads, read `.context/patterns.md`, then implement.

**Record findings immediately.** Every probe iteration leaves a FINDING in beads.
Every discovered gotcha becomes a LEARNED. Don't defer — write during the work.
```
bd comment {ID} "FINDING [tag]: exact observation with field names, error codes, behavior"
bd comment {ID} "LEARNED [tag]: generalized conclusion, gotcha for future use"
```
Every `[tag]` in a comment → matching label on the bead: `bd label add {ID} {tag}`.
Tags are text inside comments; labels are bead metadata for `bd search --label {tag}`.

**Mark assumptions.** Any decision without full verification:
```
bd comment {ID} "ASSUMPTION [tag]: what was assumed and why (alternative if wrong)"
```

**Compound before compact.** Before `/compact`, extract knowledge to patterns.md,
record stopping point in beads, update .designs/ if contracts changed.
Load skill `@skills/compound` for the full procedure.

**Check constitution before deciding.** Before architectural choices, verify
against `constitution.md`. Violations require explicit justification.

## Knowledge Routing

Every piece of knowledge has exactly one destination — except LEARNED, which goes to **both** storages:

| What | Where | Format |
|------|-------|--------|
| Probe result (exact data) | beads comment | `FINDING [tag]: ...` |
| Gotcha for future sessions | **beads comment AND patterns.md** | `LEARNED [tag]: ...` |
| Unverified decision | beads comment | `ASSUMPTION [tag]: ...` |
| Task state, blocking, next steps | beads (`bd ready`, `bd prime`) | bd update/close/create |
| Architecture decision (why) | `.designs/` or ADR | design-doc slice or decision record |
| Module contract (types, fields) | `.designs/{module}.md` | YAML code block |
| Cross-module invariant | `.designs/invariants.md` | Numbered rules |

**LEARNED goes to both storages — always.** They serve different purposes:
- **beads**: searchable by labels — `bd search --label com`, `bd list --label sql --all`
- **patterns.md**: loaded at session start, available before any bead is opened

Writing only to patterns.md loses label-based search. Writing only to beads
loses visibility at session start. Neither replaces the other.

**Project knowledge belongs in project files, not in auto-memory.**

## Comment Convention

**Prefixes:**
- `FINDING:` — probe iteration result (exact data: field names, error codes, actual behavior)
- `LEARNED:` — generalized gotcha (visible to neighbor nodes and future sessions)
- `ASSUMPTION:` — decision without full verification (reviewed on finalize)
- `SUPERSEDED:` — previous knowledge replaced (original stays, marked as changed)
- `BLOCKED:` — need user decision (list options A, B, C)

**Tags** — domain/stack level, 1-3 per record, lowercase:
`[com]`, `[sql]`, `[dotnet]`, `[kafka]`, `[rest]`, `[grpc]`, `[vendorx]`

**Labels** — same domain vocabulary, applied to the bead itself (not comments).
Add at creation (`bd create "title" --labels com,sql`) or during work (`bd label add {ID} kafka`).
Labels mirror the tags in your comments — if you write `[com, vendorx]` in FINDINGs,
the bead should carry labels `com`, `vendorx`.

## Node Lifecycle (Summary)

Each task follows: **plan** → [**discover**] → **investigate** → [**discuss** → **approve** → **probe** → **record**]* → **finalize**

Hard rules:
1. Every probe must leave a FINDING (knowledge lost otherwise)
2. Before `bd close`: review ALL ASSUMPTION records
3. Before finalize: verify blocking status with user

## Project Context

<!-- Replace this section with your project-specific context -->
<!-- Example:
**Domain:** {brief description}
**Platform:** {Windows/.NET/Linux/Rust/etc}
**Key constraint:** {e.g., "COM API is STA-only — serialize all calls"}
**External systems:** {list proprietary systems this project integrates with}
**Reference:** `.context/patterns.md` for known gotchas
**Constitution:** `constitution.md` for architectural gates
